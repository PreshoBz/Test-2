# CMPS2131 - Test #2: Hashing

## Topics Chosen

- **Hashing Algorithm**: Division Method
- **Collision Resolution**: Linear Probing

## Code Summary

This project demonstrates how the Division Method is used to hash values into a table of fixed size, and how Linear Probing handles collisions.

### Example:
Keys inserted: 18, 41, 22, 44, 59, 28  
Table size: 10  
Hash function: `h(key) = key % 10`  
Collisions are resolved by checking the next available index.
